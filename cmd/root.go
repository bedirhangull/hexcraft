	Short: "A CLI tool for generating hexagonal architecture for microservices in Go",
	Long: `Hexcraft is a command-line tool that helps you quickly generate the necessary files and structure
for creating a microservice using the hexagonal architecture pattern in Go.

The hexagonal architecture, also known as the ports and adapters architecture, provides a clean and
maintainable structure for building microservices. It separates the core business logic from the external
dependencies and infrastructure, making the code more modular and easier to test.

With Hexcraft, you can easily scaffold a new microservice project with the hexagonal architecture layout,
including the necessary packages, interfaces, and starter code. It saves you time and effort in setting up
the project structure manually.`,

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
